<!-- i totally missed the part of the criteria where it said to edit this on github. So I got up to typing about bracket expressions before I notice, I apologize!! -->

<!-- d = digit, w = word based W = non word based(symbol/white space), d = non digit(any character like W), s = white space
. = any character, * = 0 or more. so i'm assuming regex for an email would be like .* /@ /. .* .. [] explains what characters it can be, like [a-d1-4_-] means it'll look for any letter a through d, any number 1 through 4, or any underscore or hyphen. the hyphen between letters or numbers doesn't count. it will also only look for lowercase letters. If it was [^a-d] it'd only look for the uppercase letters A through D, -->

Regular expressions, or **regex**, are used to search for specific phrases or characters in a document. They help find objects that might not be easy to search just by hitting CTRL + F, such as if you were looking for any group of objects in a file that could have different characters, such as emails, usernames, or phone numbers.

## Summary

<!-- Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary. -->

In this tutorial, the regex being explained will be one that matches emails. Here is the expression used:

>```^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$```

<!-- had to put the spaces after the backslashs in line 20 so that it would show on the file preview!!-->

Basically, this regex will look for a string, followed by an asperand, another string, a period, and then one last string. Read ahead to see what each component of this expression does!

## Regex Components

### Anchors

There are 2 anchors used in regex. In the expression listed above, we use both of them, ```^``` and ```$```.

The ```^``` at the beginning of the expression means that the string being searched will have to start with any of the characters specified in the brackets after the ```^```, in this case whichever characters are specified in ```[a-z0-9_\.-]```

The ```$``` at the end of the expression means that the string being searched will end with any of the characters in the last brackets, in this case ```[a-z\.]```.

### Quantifiers

Regex also uses quantifiers to narrow down our search criteria. This specific expression specifically is using ```+``` and ```{}```.

The ```+``` means that it'll match the pattern in both the first and seconds brackets (```[a-z0-9_\.-]``` and ```[\da-z\.-]```) as many times as it can, at least once, meaning the first and second string of characters can be any length.

The ```{}``` here are matching the pattern in the last backets a specfic amount of times, in this case it wants to match it to a string that is between 2 and 6 characters long.

```{}``` quantifiers can also match for a specific pattern length (ie, ```{3}``` would look for a string that is exactly 3 characters long), or a string that is at least a specific length. (ie, ```{3,}``` _with the comma_ would look for a string that is at least 3 characters long.)

There's also the ```*``` and ```?``` quantifiers. ```*``` will match the pattern at least zero times (in comparison, ```+``` has to match at least once). ```?``` will match the pattern up to once, including zero.

<!-- ^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$ putting this here so i can look at it while i'm typing instead of going up and down in the file lol -->

### OR Operator

The OR operator ```|```, which we are not using in this regex, is used to search for a string that matches a pattern set either before or after the ```|``` in a bracket, ie:

```[1|a]``` would search for a string that is either "1" or "a" (without the quotations, obviously).  

### Character Classes

Regex uses different character classes to help specify searches as well.

This expression uses a couple:

```\d``` looks for any number 0 through 9.

```[]``` are also character classes. An example of this would be ```[0,9]```, which would search for the same pattern as ```\d``` (explained above).

There are several others. A few that I know off the top of my head are..
<!-- 
d = digit, w = word based W = non word based(symbol/white space), d = non digit(any character like W), s = white space -->

- ```\w``` would look for any word based character.
- ```\W``` on the other hand, would work like any character that isn't word based, ie a number, special character, or white space.
- ```\D``` is similar to ```\W``` - it'll look for any character that isn't a number, ie a letter, special character, or white space.
- ```\s``` would search specifically for white space.

### Flags

Another component of regex is flags, such as ```g```, ```i```, or ```m```.

- ```g``` is a global search - it'll test all possible matches of a string.
- ```i``` means it'll search for all matches of a string, regardless of it being uppercase or lowercase. (as opposed to typing out as [a-zA-Z], you can type [a-z]\i)
- ```m``` will search for a match and ignore if it's across multiple lines of the file. (in this case, it would match if the email was typed out with "example@a" on line 1, and "ol.com" on line 2.)

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

This regex uses bracket expressions to search for strings based off of the subexpressions defined between the brackets.. In this one, there's 3 different ones used:

```[a-z0-9_\.-]```, ```[\da-z\.-]```, and ```[a-z\.]```

These will look for strings that match any of the conditions in the subexpressions, but not necessarily all of them.
